- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score 
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn 
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, 
- it's the next player's turn - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
